        Description: We believe the tech field and computer science are becoming more and more saturated as 
        many individuals see a job field with flexible hours, the possibility for remote work, and a high salary, 
        and assume tech to be the best option. However, what many students don't account for or do not have the 
        knowledge of is that the computer science major is focused more on theory or understanding why computers 
        work the way they do rather than building the practical skills that will be necessary to secure a high 
        paying job in the tech field. As this field grows the need for tech literate positions and skilled software 
        engineers also rises. That is why our mission in creating this club is to help build these practical skills 
        that members will be able to use in the future to secure a job. This club will include technical skills such 
        as practical Web development basics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React along with a sprinkle of backend 
        and interview prep through programs such as Leetcode and FreeCodeCamp. Along with building soft skills such as 
        cooperation, leadership, and an innovative thought process. The club will center its curriculum around small group
         work of 5 people or less to build connections between the students and prepare them for a career where cooperative 
         work is necessary. Finally, we want to provide opportunities for networking whether it be with tech companies,
        or colleges that focus deeper into tech. Finding the right connections to push towards a successful future is 
        our main objective.
